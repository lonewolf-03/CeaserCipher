The test files and the results are created by the code in the current directory (not the sample results directory). The sample results directory contains only the statisitcs file of a previous test without the actual test files ,  the encrypted files, and the decrypted files. If you wan't to see the actual test files and the results, run the Test.java file. The test files are named file1, file2, ... file8.
Naming convention:
e.g. file1
file1-1.enc --> file1 encrypted by a single thread
file1-2.enc --> file1 encrypted by two threads.
and so on 

file1-1.dec --> file1 decrypted by a single thread
file1-2.dec --> file1 decrypted by two threads

for each file, the tests for encryption and decryption are done using one, two, five, seven, and ten threads.
